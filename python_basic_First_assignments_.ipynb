        "\n",
        "   Ans:-Good question — it gets to the heart of how Python is designed. Let's break it down clearly:\n",
        "\n",
        "    List is mutable\n",
        "\n",
        "A list in Python is defined like this:\n",
        "\n",
        "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "\n",
        "Mutable means you can:\n",
        "\n",
        "Change existing elements → my_list[0] = 10\n",
        "\n",
        "Add new elements → my_list.append(4)\n",
        "\n",
        "Remove elements → my_list.pop()\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "    Why is it mutable?\n",
        "\n",
        "Lists are designed to be flexible and dynamic.\n",
        "\n",
        "Internally, Python stores lists as arrays of object references — this allows efficient resizing and element updates.\n",
        "\n",
        "Many use-cases (such as collecting data, modifying elements) need this flexibility.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Tuple is immutable\n",
        "\n",
        "A tuple is defined like this:\n",

        "Immutable means you cannot:\n",
        "\n",
        "Change any element → my_tuple[0] = 10 →  error\n",
        "\n",
        "Add or remove elements after creation → no .append(), no .pop()\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "    Why is it immutable?\n",
        "\n",
        "Tuples are often used to represent fixed collections of data (coordinates, settings, dictionary keys, etc.).\n",
        "\n",
        "Once created, the tuple guarantees that its content won't change — this helps with:\n",
        "\n",
        "Safety: Code can trust that the data stays constant.\n",
        "\n",
        "Hashability: Immutable objects like tuples can be used as dictionary keys or set elements.\n",
        "\n",
        "Performance: Python can optimize storage of immutable objects more effectively.\n",

        "    Question 7:- What is the difference between\"==\" and \"is\" in python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:-Good question! In Python, == and is are both comparison operators, but they are used for different purposes:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. == → Equality Operator\n",

        "\n",

        "    b = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "    print(a == b)  # True → because the lists have the same conten\n",

        "2. is → Identity Operator\n",
        "\n",
        "It checks whether two variables refer to the same object in memory (same identity).\n",
        "\n",
        "It cannot be overridden.\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
        " \"else if\"\n",
        "\n",
        "It is used when you want to check multiple conditions, one after another.\n",

        "\n",
        "    How it works:\n",
        "\n",
        "     The program checks the first if condition:\n",
        "\n",
        "     If it is True, that block runs, and the rest (elif, else) are skipped.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "     If none of the if or elif conditions are True, the else block (if provided) runs.\n",

        "    number = 0\n",
        "\n",
        "    if number > 0:\n",
